# inventory
A C# app to control basic inventory

# Info

In this C# app I used windows forms, file read/write in order to keep track of an inventory.

Features:
a)Load inventory
b)Delete item
c)Update sold quantity
d)Update restocked quantity
e)Save inventory to a file
f)Save sales report
g)Save restock needs report

Also I put a Label to display meaningful message to the user when some action is taken or a condition is not met (delete an item that is not on stock).
